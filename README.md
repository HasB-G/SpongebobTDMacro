This is the one that I have used for all of my macros
* Hash could possibly be swapped out for Cyborg
* Rhino could possibly be swapped for a sw 5* Richhard
* Davy Jones and Chum only uses Units 1,2,4,5 the rest can be filler

## Menus and what they do

**Join Server/Launch Game** Used when out of the game: launches roblox if not already open and joins your private server running the selected mode from then onwards

## Configuration

Macro moving too quick?

You could adjust the sleep timings (in ms)

## Notes

Everything is done automatically after makign a selection

In case going to level fails theres checks in place to try again so you could run it 24/7

Any bugs let me know :)
