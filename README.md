## Configuration

The first time you change resolution, `settings.ini` is created:

```ini
[Display]
Resolution=1440p  ; or 1080p
```

Macros read this file at startup to adjust clicks and image regions accordingly.

## Updating Images
You will need to update the GameIcon.png if the game is updated
To do this use Win + Shift + S
Take a screenshot of the game icon similiar to the one in the images folder
Replace the image under the same name
